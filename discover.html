<div class ="info3">
    <p> The history of multiple traditions and ethnicities being brought together by the Ottoman Empire
        is what created this magic.
    </p>

    <p> The cooperation of old and modern architecture enables visitors to experience old palaces,
        sanctuaries and additionally modern bridges and skyscrapers.
    </p>

    <p> Food is a big part of Turkish culture, which in itself is a reason to visit.
        From the well-known kebab, baklava and Turkish coffee, to lesser known enjoyable dishes,
        they will all offer an adventure that must be experienced.
    </p>

    <P> The beautiful nature and hot weather create a perfect atmosphere for people who would just want to relax.
        The Turkish population are always grateful for visitors and will present great company.
